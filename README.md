## 🔑 Key Highlights

### 📌 Week 01 — Pandas Data Cleaning
- Cleaned a **1000-row Indian E-Commerce dataset** with 24 columns
- Handled missing values, removed ₹ symbols, filtered by rating ≥ 4.0
- Created derived column `total_amount = final_price × ratings_count`
- Exported clean data as `Combined_dataset_CLEANED.csv`

### 📌 Week 02 — SQL Sales Analysis (ShopEase DB)
- Built a relational database from scratch with **4 tables, 27 queries**
- Covered SQL Basics → Filtering → Aggregation → Joins → Transactions
- Demonstrated ACID properties with real BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK transactions
- Used CASE statements, HAVING, indexes, and SARGable query rewrites

### 📌 Week 03 — Advanced SQL (Superstore)
- Analyzed **9,994 rows** of Superstore sales data
- Applied correlated subqueries, CTEs, and 3 types of window functions
- Identified top customer **Sean Miller (₹25,043)** and churn risks (12 single-order customers)
- Built a final combined query using **JOIN + CTE + DENSE_RANK()** together


### 📌 Week 04 — Azure Cloud & ADF Pipeline
- Provisioned end-to-end Azure infrastructure: Resource Group → Storage Account → Blob Containers
- Uploaded Sample Superstore CSV as source data in Blob Storage
- Built ADF pipeline pl_CopySuperstoreData with Get Metadata + Copy Data activities
- Validated file metadata (itemName, size, columnCount) before triggering data copy
- Successfully copied data to destination container — output_superstore.csv 
- Implemented RBAC with Reader, Contributor, and Storage Blob Data Contributor roles

 ### 📌 Week 5 Spark Assignment 
 
- Set up an Apache Spark (PySpark) environment and loaded a 1000-row e-commerce dataset into Spark DataFrames.
- Cleaned real-world messy data by removing duplicates, handling null values, filling missing fields, and filtering invalid records.
- Applied DataFrame transformations such as filtering, renaming columns, type casting, and selecting relevant data.
- Performed aggregations using count(), sum(), avg(), min(), and max(), along with groupBy() operations.
- Built a complete Spark pipeline combining data cleaning, transformation, and revenue aggregation by store.

  ### 📌 Week 06 — Apache Spark (Architecture & Pipelines)
- Studied Spark's core architecture — roles of the **Driver**, **Cluster Manager**, and **Executors** — and the difference between **Client Mode** and **Cluster Mode**
- Explained **Lazy Evaluation** and how Spark builds an optimized execution plan (DAG) before running any job
- Understood how Spark uses the **Lineage Graph** for fault tolerance — recomputing only lost partitions instead of restarting the whole job on node failure
- Compared **CSV vs Parquet** storage (row-based vs columnar) and explained **Predicate Pushdown** in Parquet for reduced memory usage
- Tested all DataFrame operations on a custom **1000-row dataset** — filtering, renaming columns, type casting, multi-condition filters (AND/OR), and derived columns
- Built a complete **read → transform → filter → write pipeline**: loaded Parquet, removed null `user_id` rows, and saved clean output as CSV
- Practiced best practices for large datasets — avoided `.collect()`, used `.show(5)` for safe data exploration


### 📌 Week 07 — Delta Lake (SCD Type-1)

- Built an end-to-end **Delta Lake pipeline** using Apache Spark and Delta Lake.
- Loaded the customer master dataset and stored it as a **Delta Table**.
- Performed data validation by checking for null values and duplicate records before processing.
- Created an incremental (CDC-style) dataset containing both updated existing customers and new customer records.
- Applied **MERGE INTO** to implement **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD Type-1)** by updating existing rows and inserting new ones atomically.
- Validated the final Delta table by verifying row counts, updates, inserts, and duplicate-free primary keys.
- Demonstrated Delta Lake features including **ACID Transactions**, **Schema Enforcement**, and efficient incremental data processing.

## 🧠 Learnings & Reflections

- Learned why **correlated subqueries are slow** and how CTEs are a cleaner alternative
- Understood the real difference between **RANK() vs DENSE_RANK()** through hands-on queries
- Realized how **window functions preserve row-level detail** while still doing aggregations
- Appreciated how **good database design** (normalized tables) makes queries faster and cleaner
- Grew comfortable reading and writing **production-style SQL** with proper comments
- Understood how Azure Resource Groups act as logical boundaries for cost and access management
- Learned how ADF Linked Services decouple connection logic from pipeline logic
- Experienced how metadata-driven pipelines make ETL workflows dynamic and fault-tolerant
- Applied Principle of Least Privilege using Azure IAM role assignments in a real cloud environment
- Developed a strong understanding of Apache Spark's DataFrame operations, including data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and building efficient data-processing pipelines on large datasets.
- This assignment provided practical experience in handling real-world messy data and demonstrated how proper data cleaning and transformation are essential for producing accurate and meaningful analytical results.
- Understood why **lazy evaluation** matters — Spark optimizes the entire chain of transformations before execution instead of running each step blindly
- Realized that Spark's fault tolerance comes from its **lineage graph**, not data replication — failed partitions are simply recomputed from their transformation history
- Learned practically why **Parquet outperforms CSV** for analytics — columnar storage means only required columns get read off disk
- Understood **predicate pushdown** — filtering at the storage layer itself reduces the amount of data pulled into memory
- Built the habit of using `.show()` instead of `.collect()` — a small change in approach that matters a lot once datasets scale to production size
- Learned the real difference between running separate UPDATE/INSERT operations vs. Delta Lake's MERGE INTO, which does both atomically in a single transaction — no risk of partial writes.
- Understood that a Delta table is not just Parquet with a different name — re-reading the table after write proved the ACID durability guarantee in practice, not just in theory.
- Realized that clean data isn't a failure of the exercise — reporting an honest "0 nulls, 0 duplicates" result is still a valid, necessary validation step.
- Practiced designing a realistic incremental (CDC-style) batch — a mix of updated existing rows and genuinely new rows, rather than arbitrary random data.
- Learned that validation is what makes a pipeline trustworthy — checking exact row counts and duplicate keys after merge is what proves the operation worked, not just an assumption.
- Understood why working at the natural row-level grain of a dataset (rather than forcing an aggregation the task didn't ask for) keeps a MERGE pipeline simpler and closer to real-world usage.
